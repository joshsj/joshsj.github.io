  p
    | Analysing a problem involves identifying the overriding problem to establish its
    | causes and effects, plus the goals of its solution.
  // more
  p To analyse the goals of a system, we can first look at 
    em usability
    | &mdash; the
    | functional impact of a system:
  ul
    li Effective to use
    li Efficient to use
    li Safe to use
    li Have good utility
    li Easy to learn
    li Easy to remember how to use
  p We can also look at 
    em User Experience (UX)
    | &mdash; the effect of a system on the
    | user:
  ul
    li Satisfying
    li Enjoyable
    li Engaging
    li Pleasurable
    li Exciting
    li Entertaining
    li Helpful
    li Motivating
    li Emotionally fulfilling
  h2 User Profiles
  p A 
    em user profile
    | are a set of characteristics taken from a typical user of a
    | system. A product can have any number of user profiles, depending on the scope
    | of the system's demographic. Attributes should be all/only be relevant to the
    | system; for example:
  ul
    li Age range
    li Physical competences
    li Perceptual competences
    li Education Level
    li Domain Knowledge & experience
    li Interests
    li Financial status
    li Social grouping
    li Religion, nationality, culture
  p If we consider a teenager, we get:
  blockquote
    ul
      li 13 to 18
      li Limited finances
      li Varied physical strength (but considerable energy)
      li Likely to have good hand-eye coordination
      li Education is varied but likely to be full-time
      li Interests 'youth-related'
      li Cohesive peer group
      li Possibly limited respect for authorityâ€¦
  h2 Personas
  p Where user profiles are a generic assessment of the user-base, 
    em user personas
    | are rich descriptions of typical users for a system. By specifying the target
    | user(s), designed can further tailor a product to its end-users.
  p
    | They specify a theoretical or an actual end-user requiring an age, personal
    | background, personal needs, etc., and are formatted as a paragraph.

  h2 Task Analysis
  p
    | This a generic term referring to a variety of techniques for analysing and
    | representing goals and tasks.
  p
    em User goals
    | are derived from the activities in which end-users engage: a state
    | an end-user wishes to achieve.
  p
    em User tasks
    | describe the functionality to achieve a task: a user activity
    | required to bring about a goal.
  p
    | For example, the goal, 'know where next week's lecture is', can be described
    | with a task, 'a user activity required to bring about a goal '.
  p A working design can be validated through a comparison to user goals and tasks:
  ul
    li Does it reduce user effort?
    li Does it improve user performance?
    li Does it aid/assist their use?
  h2 Scenarios
  p
    em Scenarios
    | are an informal narrative story: simple, 'natural', personal, and
    | not generalisable. Ultimately, these target the when and where, referred to as
    | the system's context.
  p
    | Physical context could include where the user is, what their physical situation
    | is, and what else is happening around them. Temporal context could include:
    | timing, order of events, and other events.
  p A basic outline of a scenario consists of:
  ul
    li Names of the individuals
    li Where they are
    li Why they are doing 'it' (the action in the scenario)
    li Describe what else they are doing at the same time
