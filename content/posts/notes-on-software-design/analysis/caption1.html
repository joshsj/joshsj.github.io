<p><em>Betty is 37 years old, she has been Warehouse Manager for five years and worked
for Simpkins Brothers Engineering for twelve years. She didn&#39;t go to university,
but has studied in her evenings for a business diploma. She has two children
aged 15 and 7 and does not like to work late. She did part of an introductory
in-house computer course some years ago, but it was interrupted when she was
promoted and could no longer afford to take the time. Her vision is perfect, but
her right-hand movement is slightly restricted following an car accident three
years ago. She is enthusiastic about her work and is happy to delegate
responsibility and take suggestions from her staff. However, she does feel
threatened by the introduction of yet another new computer system (the third in
her time at SBE)</em></p>
