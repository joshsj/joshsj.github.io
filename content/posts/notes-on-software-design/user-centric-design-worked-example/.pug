  h2 Observations
  ul
    li
      p Discusses the role of an average bin collector in a city
    li
      p The current system is inefficient
      ul
        li
          | Information on bin capacity is non-existant so all bins must be checked for
          | litter
        li Time is wasted on empty bins meaning routes may not be completed
    li
      p The council wants to add sensors to bins
      ul
        li
          | Only bins that require collection will be scheduled, optimising the
          | collection process
        li Workload is reduced for bin men
        li General public will shut the fuck up
        li
          | Local council save money on wages for scheduling roles and
          | complaints-handling
  h2 Persona
  p (I couldn&#39;t be bothered to make one ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
  h2 Scenario
  ol
    li James, a 28-year-old bin man, has gotten ready for work
    li He carries everyday items, such as his phone, and his keys for his work van
    li He checks which bins need collecting and starts his route
  h2 Goals
  ul
    li Functionality
      ul
        li Remotely accessible: it&#39;s a job on the move
        li Available without internet connection: may not always have a connection
    li Context factors
      ul
        li Events around the city: can additional bin-usage be expected&#x2F;predicted?
    li Usability goals
      ul
        li Easy to read on the move
    li UX goals
      ul
        li Reliable
