  +quote("User persona example")
    p.
      James is a 28-year-old man that works as a waste bin collector for the local
      city council. Part of his job is to empty the bins around the city in public
      spaces (parks, high streets, etc). He is generally healthy, lives an active
      lifestyle and doesn't have any health conditions that affect his ability to
      complete his job. He owns a smartphone, which he uses regularly in his
      day-today life.

    p.
      James has a scheduled timetable that he uses for his daily
      routine, however, there are times when the bins in certain areas are empty,
      this means that James ends up not collecting any trash leaving other areas
      with excess trash in the bin. This is quite inefficient and James needs a
      more robust approach in completing his bin route around the city.

    p.
      The local city council wants an interconnected sensor network with installed sensors
      on all of the bins around the city, letting James know how full certain bins
      are and whether they need emptying or not, saving him time by skipping out
      particular bins if necessary. Furthermore, the data collected by the sensors
      is leveraged by the council to figure out if more bins are required in
      particular areas of the city.

  h2 Observations
  ul
    li
      p Discusses the role of an average bin collector in a city
    li
      p The current system is inefficient
      ul
        li
          | Information on bin capacity is non-existant so all bins must be checked for
          | litter
        li Time is wasted on empty bins meaning routes may not be completed
    li
      p The council wants to add sensors to bins
      ul
        li
          | Only bins that require collection will be scheduled, optimising the
          | collection process
        li Workload is reduced for bin men
        li General public will shut the fuck up
        li
          | Local council save money on wages for scheduling roles and
          | complaints-handling
  h2 Persona
  p (I couldn't be bothered to make one ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

  h2 Scenario
  ol
    li James, a 28-year-old bin man, has gotten ready for work
    li He carries everyday items, such as his phone, and his keys for his work van
    li He checks which bins need collecting and starts his route

  h2 Goals
  ul
    li Functionality
      ul
        li Remotely accessible: it's a job on the move
        li Available without internet connection: may not always have a connection
    li Context factors
      ul
        li Events around the city: can additional bin-usage be expected/predicted?
    li Usability goals
      ul
        li Easy to read on the move
    li UX goals
      ul
        li Reliable
