<p>James is a 28-year-old man that works as a waste bin collector for the local
city council. Part of his job is to empty the bins around the city in public
spaces (parks, high streets, etc). He is generally healthy, lives an active
lifestyle and doesn&#39;t have any health conditions that affect his ability to
complete his job. He owns a smartphone, which he uses regularly in his
day-today life. James has a scheduled timetable that he uses for his daily
routine, however, there are times when the bins in certain areas are empty,
this means that James ends up not collecting any trash leaving other areas
with excess trash in the bin. This is quite inefficient and James needs a more
robust approach in completing his bin route around the city. The local city
council wants an interconnected sensor network with installed sensors on all
of the bins around the city, letting James know how full certain bins are and
whether they need emptying or not, saving him time by skipping out particular
bins if necessary. Furthermore, the data collected by the sensors is leveraged
by the council to figure out if more bins are required in particular areas of
the city.</p>
