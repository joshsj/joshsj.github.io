    | I like BikeFitJames. As he often explains, many bike fitters are very
    | systematic, relying exclusively on data produced by specialized equipment to
    | conclude how an individual should interact with their bicycle.
  p
    | This series, plus supporting vlogs, demonstrate why this is a poor approach, why
    | a pragmatic approach is better, and how he gets people comfortable on a bike.
    | Thanks James.

  h2 An Outline
  p People interact with a bike in three places:
  ul
    li
      em Controls
      | (handlebars and levers)
    li
      em Saddle
      | (or seat)
    li
      em Pedals
  p
    | The pedals and saddle are the foundation of a bike fit, as they receive the
    | rider's power and (most of) their weight respectively. The placement of the
    | controls is then dictated by their physiological needs (e.g., flexibility) and
    | end-goal (e.g., aero).
  p
    | All three aspects are directly linked; none should be set up in isolation. For
    | example, moving the saddle backwards increases the reach, so something else must
    | change to preserve the correct reach (if it was correct in the first place).
  h2 Effects of bicycle design
  p
    | As the sport has evolved, bicycle design has changed to reflect (and motivate)
    | the needs of riders. A traditional 56cm frame would measure 56cm on both the top
    | tube and seat tube with little handlebar drop. Modern race-oriented frames are
    | more aggressive; a longer top tube places more weight towards the front of the
    | bike and long 'n' low stems typically add reach and handlebar drop. Drivetrain
    | advancements, such as press-fit bottom brackets, have also narrowed bikes.

  h2 Adapting to a poor position
  p
    | This has lead to a common problem in bike fitting: many everyday people struggle
    | to get comfortable on their expensive bikes. Maintaining an aggressive position
    | requires flexibility, strength, and little upper body mass &mdash; a pro. A typical
    | desk worker is top-heavy and lacks flexibility; hitting the gym can add strength
    | but more muscle means more weight to support on the handlebars, especially with
    | people's tendency to skip leg day.
  p
    | Although the human body can adapt to unergonomic positions very well, bad
    | positions often necessitate
    em acts of sacrifice
    | : unconscious adjustments made by
    | body to achieve a more stable and sustainable position. A very common example is
    | seen with excess saddle height, where riders sit off to their dominant side of
    | the saddle. This causes an asymmetric interaction with the bike, often leading
    | to one-sided issues (e.g., saddle sores on the non-dominant side) and an
    | imbalance of power output.

  // Another common problem often faced in bike fitting is
  h2 Stance
  p
    | The horizontal distance between your feet on the pedals. It is not the same as
    em q-factor
    | , which instead measures the horizontal distance between the crank
    | arms.
  h3 Measurement
  // TODO
  h3 Adjustment
  p
    | The easiest and free-est starting point is the cleat placement in the shoe: move
    | them inwards to increase stance, move them outwards to decrease stance.
  p
    | Next come pedal washers, up to ~2mm. Any longer and you start running out of
    | pedal threads. Pedal spindle extenders and long-axle pedals get around this
    | issue for a little more money.
  p
    | Lastly, q-factor can also change stance, however needing new cranks to eek out
    | your stance to the extreme suggests a proper bike fit is in order.

  h2 Handlebar Width
  p
    | The horizontal measurement of the handlebars, at the point of attachment for the
    | levers.
  h3 Measurement
  p
    | When measuring bar width, make sure to measure on the top of the bars as some
    | handlebars are flared, meaning they're wider at the bottom than on the tops.
  p
    | Another important note is that not all manufacturers measure center-to-center,
    | meaning the middle of the tube. Some manufacturers measure outside-to-outside,
    | so make sure to check how the manufacturer measures to avoid buying the wrong
    | thing. The most common approach is c-t-c.
  // TODO example for these manufacturers
  h3 Adjustments
  p The only way to change handlebar width is by changing your handlebars ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
