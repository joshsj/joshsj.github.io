As he often explains, many bike fitters are very
systematic, relying exclusively on data produced by specialized equipment to
conclude how an individual should interact with their bicycle.</p><p>This series, plus supporting vlogs, demonstrate why this is a poor approach, why
a pragmatic approach is better, and how he gets people comfortable on a bike.
Thanks James.</p><h2>To Do</h2><ul><li>Saddle Height</li><li>Saddle Setback</li><li>Saddle Tilt</li><li>Saddle Width</li><li>Handlebar Reach</li><li>Handlebar Drop</li><li>Handlebar Width</li><li>Shoes</li><li>Crank length?</li><li>Add diagrams for all</li><li>Reorder</li></ul><h2>An Outline</h2><p>People interact with a bike in three places:</p><ul><li><em>Controls</em>(handlebars and levers)</li><li><em>Saddle</em>(or seat)</li><li><em>Pedals</em></li></ul><p>The pedals and saddle are the foundation of a bike fit, as they receive the
rider's power and (most of) their weight respectively. The placement of the
controls is then dictated by their physiological needs (e.g., flexibility) and
end-goal (e.g., aero).</p><p>All three aspects are directly linked; none should be set up in isolation. For
example, moving the saddle backwards increases the reach, so something else must
change to preserve the correct reach (if it was correct in the first place).</p><h2>Effects of bicycle design</h2><p>As the sport has evolved, bicycle design has changed to reflect (and motivate)
the needs of riders. A traditional 56cm frame would measure 56cm on both the top
tube and seat tube with little handlebar drop. Modern race-oriented frames are
more aggressive; a longer top tube places more weight towards the front of the
bike and long 'n' low stems typically add reach and handlebar drop. Drivetrain
advancements, such as press-fit bottom brackets, have also narrowed bikes.</p><figure><div class="inner"><img src="bike.jpg"></div><figcaption><a class="source" href="https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/pro-bike-adam-hansens-ridley-helium-sl">Source</a>Adam Hansen's Ridley Helium SL.</figcaption></figure><h2>Adapting to a poor position</h2><p>This has lead to a common problem in bike fitting: many everyday people struggle
to get comfortable on their expensive bikes. Maintaining an aggressive position
requires flexibility, strength, and little upper body mass &mdash; a pro. A typical
desk worker is top-heavy and lacks flexibility; hitting the gym can add strength
but more muscle means more weight to support on the handlebars, especially with
people's tendency to skip leg day.</p><p>Although the human body can adapt to unergonomic positions very well, bad
positions often necessitate<em>acts of sacrifice</em>: unconscious adjustments made by
body to achieve a more stable and sustainable position. A very common example is
seen with excess saddle height, where riders sit off to their dominant side of
the saddle. This causes an asymmetric interaction with the bike, often leading
to one-sided issues (e.g., saddle sores on the non-dominant side) and an
imbalance of power output.</p><!-- TODO physios--><!-- Another common problem often faced in bike fitting is--><h2>Stance</h2><p>The horizontal distance between your feet on the pedals. It is not the same as<em>q-factor</em>, which instead measures the horizontal distance between the crank
arms.</p><h3>Measurement</h3><!-- TODO--><h3>Adjustment</h3><p>The easiest and free-est starting point is the cleat placement in the shoe: move
them inwards to increase stance, move them outwards to decrease stance.</p><p>Next come pedal washers, up to ~2mm. Any longer and you start running out of
pedal threads. Pedal spindle extenders and long-axle pedals get around this
issue for a little more money.</p><p>Lastly, q-factor can also change stance, however needing new cranks to eek out
your stance to the extreme suggests a proper bike fit is in order.</p><h3>Impact</h3><!-- TODO--><h2>Handlebar Width</h2><p>The horizontal measurement of the handlebars, at the point of attachment for the
levers.</p><h3>Measurement</h3><p>When measuring bar width, make sure to measure on the top of the bars as some
handlebars are flared, meaning they're wider at the bottom than on the tops.</p><p>Another important note is that not all manufacturers measure center-to-center,
meaning the middle of the tube. Some manufacturers measure outside-to-outside,
so make sure to check how the manufacturer measures to avoid buying the wrong
thing. The most common approach is c-t-c.</p><!-- TODO example for these manufacturers--><h3>Adjustments</h3><p>The only way to change handlebar width is by changing your handlebars ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p><h3>Impact</h3></main></body></html>
