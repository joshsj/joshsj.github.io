tangible.<!-- excerpt-->The design phase is always addressed in an iterative
approach.</p><p>There are two main areas of conceptualisation: conceptual, trying to capture
what the product will do and how; and physical, the details of the design,
structure, layout etc.</p><h2>Prototypes</h2><figure><blockquote class="inner"><p>Prototyping is externalising and making concrete a design idea for the purpose of evaluation</p></blockquote><figcaption><cite>Bill Verplank</cite></figcaption></figure><p>Simply, prototypes are a tangible representations of a solution. They are the
first representation of a system for the client to accept/decline your concept
for the solution.</p><h3>Fidelity</h3><p><em>Prototype fidelity</em> describes how closely the prototype conveys the look-and-feel of the final product: low is
simple, high is complex.</p><p>Low-fidelity prototypes allow designers to conceptualise layout, structure,
interface, etc., early in the process. They are cheap and quick to produce,
e.g., wireframes.</p><p>High fidelity prototypes match the look and feel to the final product
closely/entirely, allowing designers to test the content with end users and
collect direct feedback. They are high-cost, meaning they are produced later and
to be refined and reused.</p><h3>Compromise</h3><p>All prototypes involve compromises; for software-based prototyping, this could
affect functionality, appearance, or performance. There are two types of
compromise: horizontal, having a wide range of function but little detail; and
vertical, the opposite.</p><p>Choosing the right type of compromise is important to attain more/better
feedback from the client. Users with more domain knowledge than technical would
most likely benefit from vertical prototypes; they understand the content but
the functionality is their downfall (and vice-versa).</p><h2>Storyboarding</h2><p><em>Storyboards</em> visualise a process in the application, often extending a scenario, allowing designers to address
fundamental aspects of the concept such as:</p><ul><li>Will Roger be able to read that text?</li><li>We have lots of users who are afraid of new technology; will the interface
scare them?</li><li>What happens if they don't have a bank account?</li><li>They're experienced users, will they be satisfied with a step-by-step
approach?</li></ul><h2>Wireframes</h2><p>A basic representation of the functional elements in a design concept, such as
the layout of a web page. Their quality can range from a 'back-of-an-envelope'
sketch to a full design, intended to provide an early approximation of how a
user will interact with the system. There are different types:</p><ul><li>High-level<ul><li>Structure without content</li></ul></li><li>Flow<ul><li>Demonstrate the flow of a single task</li><li>Requires multiple wireframes</li></ul></li><li>Modular wireframe<ul><li>Demonstrate the flexibility/changeability of the interface</li><li>Individual components can add/move/delete</li><li>Re-arrangeable to try different layouts</li></ul></li></ul><p>Tools for creating wireframes include <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">invision</a> or
