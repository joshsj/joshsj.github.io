city council. Part of his job is to empty the bins around the city in public
spaces (parks, high streets, etc). He is generally healthy, lives an active
lifestyle and doesn't have any health conditions that affect his ability to
complete his job. He owns a smartphone, which he uses regularly in his
day-today life.
</p><p>James has a scheduled timetable that he uses for his daily
routine, however, there are times when the bins in certain areas are empty,
this means that James ends up not collecting any trash leaving other areas
with excess trash in the bin. This is quite inefficient and James needs a
more robust approach in completing his bin route around the city.
</p><p>The local city council wants an interconnected sensor network with installed sensors
on all of the bins around the city, letting James know how full certain bins
are and whether they need emptying or not, saving him time by skipping out
particular bins if necessary. Furthermore, the data collected by the sensors
is leveraged by the council to figure out if more bins are required in
particular areas of the city.
