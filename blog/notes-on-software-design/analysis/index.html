causes and effects, plus the goals of its solution.</p><!-- more--><p>To analyse the goals of a system, we can first look at <em>usability</em>&mdash; the
functional impact of a system:</p><ul><li>Effective to use</li><li>Efficient to use</li><li>Safe to use</li><li>Have good utility</li><li>Easy to learn</li><li>Easy to remember how to use</li></ul><p>We can also look at <em>User Experience (UX)</em> &mdash; the effect of a system on the user:</p><ul><li>Satisfying</li><li>Enjoyable</li><li>Engaging</li><li>Pleasurable</li><li>Exciting</li><li>Entertaining</li><li>Helpful</li><li>Motivating</li><li>Emotionally fulfilling</li></ul><h2>User Profiles</h2><p>A <em>user profile</em> are a set of characteristics taken from a typical user of a system. A product can have any
number of user profiles, depending on the scope of the system's demographic. Attributes should be all/only be
relevant to the system; for example:</p><ul><li>Age range</li><li>Physical competences</li><li>Perceptual competences</li><li>Education Level</li><li>Domain Knowledge & experience</li><li>Interests</li><li>Financial status</li><li>Social grouping</li><li>Religion, nationality, culture</li></ul><p>If we consider a teenager, we get:</p><blockquote><ul><li>13 to 18</li><li>Limited finances</li><li>Varied physical strength (but considerable energy)</li><li>Likely to have good hand-eye coordination</li><li>Education is varied but likely to be full-time</li><li>Interests 'youth-related'</li><li>Cohesive peer group</li><li>Possibly limited respect for authority…</li></ul></blockquote><h2>Personas</h2><p>Where user profiles are a generic assessment of the user-base, <em>user personas</em>are rich descriptions of typical users for a system. By specifying the target
user(s), designed can further tailor a product to its end-users.</p><p>They specify a theoretical or an actual end-user requiring an age, personal
background, personal needs, etc., and are formatted as a paragraph.</p><figure><div class="inner"><blockquote><p>Betty is 37 years old, she has been Warehouse Manager for five years and
worked for Simpkins Brothers Engineering for twelve years. She didn't go to
university, but has studied in her evenings for a business diploma. She has
two children aged 15 and 7 and does not like to work late. She did part of
an introductory in-house computer course some years ago, but it was
interrupted when she was promoted and could no longer afford to take the
time. Her vision is perfect, but her right-hand movement is slightly
restricted following an car accident three years ago. She is enthusiastic
about her work and is happy to delegate responsibility and take suggestions
from her staff. However, she does feel threatened by the introduction of yet
another new computer system (the third in her time at SBE)
</p></blockquote></div><figcaption>Example User Persona</figcaption></figure><h2>Task Analysis</h2><p>This a generic term referring to a variety of techniques for analysing and
representing goals and tasks.</p><p><em>User goals</em> are derived from the activities in which end-users engage: a state an end-user wishes to achieve.</p><p><em>User tasks</em> describe the functionality to achieve a task: a user activity required to bring about a goal.</p><p>For example, the goal, 'know where next week's lecture is', can be described
with a task, 'a user activity required to bring about a goal '.</p><p>A working design can be validated through a comparison to user goals and tasks:</p><ul><li>Does it reduce user effort?</li><li>Does it improve user performance?</li><li>Does it aid/assist their use?</li></ul><h2>Scenarios</h2><p><em>Scenarios</em> are an informal narrative story: simple, 'natural', personal, and not generalisable. Ultimately,
these target the when and where, referred to as the system's context.</p><p>Physical context could include where the user is, what their physical situation
is, and what else is happening around them. Temporal context could include:
timing, order of events, and other events.</p><p>A basic outline of a scenario consists of:</p><ul><li>Names of the individuals</li><li>Where they are</li><li>Why they are doing 'it' (the action in the scenario)</li><li>Describe what else they are doing at the same time</li></ul></main></body></html>
