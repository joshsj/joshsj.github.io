additional prerequisite jobs may be required.</p><p>Alongside the jobs which actually produce the product, the time/effort to manage the project also needs to be
scheduled, known as <em>overhead</em>. This includes project artefacts or reports.
</p><figure><div class="inner"><img src="triple constraint model.png"></div><figcaption>Triple Constraint Model</figcaption></figure><p>As a guideline, a triangle of time, cost, and scope can be conceptualised, in
which increasing/reducing one aspect will impact the other two.</p><h2>Milestones</h2><p><em>Milestones</em> are points throughout the project at which progress can be evaluated and changed; i.e.,
allocating or removing resources.</p><p>Ideally, they also illustrate progress to the customer. As well as confirming
the project is progressing, concrete artefacts can also be delivered, such as
wireframes, prototypes, or reports.</p><p>Payments are often tied to milestones. From the customer's perspective, proof of
work is a big incentive to pay up; from a management perspective, releasing an
aspect of the final solution should correspond to payment as well.</p><h2>Representations</h2><p>A good representation of a project schedule should be clear and concise. By
making a scheduling easily readable, those unfamiliar with the project can
immediately understand its intended and current progress.</p><p>This is especially important in a business context, as superiors of the PM
may/will want quick and easy updates on projects.</p><h3>Gantt</h3><p>Gantt charts represent scheduling information in horizontal bars.</p><p>Each row is labelled with a job title/summary, and additional columns can
provide additional important information, e.g., the job's team, start date, end
date, etc.</p><p>Subsequent columns indicate to when the work is allocated with a filled box,
creating the horizontal bars.</p><h2>Contingency/Slippage</h2><p>A project plan needs to account for if/when things go wrong; prudent project
managers will proactively schedule (and possibly resource) an additional margin
for slippage.</p><p>Contingency also accounts for unforeseeable delays, such as staff sickness, redundancies, or hardware failure.
As such, a project should <strong>always plan for slippage</strong>, even if it goes unused. This allows the project to
continue while management resolve the issue.</p><p>By contrast, <strong>too much contingency should be avoided</strong>; it extends the length (and subsequent cost) of the
project, which can loose tenders. It also diminishes confidence in a company if their project's are consistently
delivered early. A typical example of this designers/developers/testers over-estimating jobs.</p><p>How much contingency depend upon:</p><ul><li>How tightly the requirement is defined</li><li>Potential for scope creep<ul><li>A better the initial analysis helps to avoid this</li></ul></li><li>Confidence of the estimates<ul><li>Sometimes you just gotta guess</li></ul></li><li>Degree of innovation of the project<ul><li>The newer, the slippier</li></ul></li><li>Confidence of resources acquisition<ul><li>Consider when, how often, relationship</li></ul></li><li>Knowledge of customer<ul><li>Might be a changeable dickhead</li><li>Might lack technical knowledge</li></ul></li><li>Overall assessment of project risks</li></ul></main></body></html>
