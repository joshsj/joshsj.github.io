and the timescales/costs involved.<!-- excerpt-->No project should be undertaken
without first establishing a business case for it, as there is no justification
for it otherwise.</p><p>The progress of the project measured is against the business case to ensure
timescales/costs are not being exceeded and business benefits are not being
eroded (i.e., it is still worth doing).</p><h2>Choosing the Right Type</h2><p>Frankly, business cases are boring and confusing, easy to write poorly, and may
be unconvincing. As such, business cases are a balancing act of length: long
enough to provide sufficient detail, while short enough to maintain interest.</p><p>A <em>Summary Business Plan</em> is around 10-15 pages, best used for new ventures and early stages of development.</p><p>A <em>Full Business Plan</em> is still applicable for new ventures, but with interim stages of development, including
a blueprint of the business; these are around 25-35 pages long.</p><p>Lastly, an <em>Operational Business Plan</em>, at 40-100 pages, contains a blueprint for operations, including details
of operational and financial measures.
</p><h2>Speaking Proper</h2><p>Be <strong>specific</strong> and <strong>explicit</strong> when describing the business benefits. Avoid vague phrases like
'helps a lot', 'very important', 'too much', and 'too many'. Instead, use values, estimates, and ranges, e.g.,
<em>"We will increase customer patronage by 25%"</em>.</p><p>Be <strong>realistic</strong>. Don't make false promises about the product, instead demonstrating the benefits
and challenges.</p><p>Be <strong>conservative</strong> in objectives, costs, timescales, and deliverables; overproducing by a small amount is
great for client and makes the business look good. By contrast, being too conservative impresses to the customer
that estimations about your own work aren't accurate.</p><p>Use <strong>visuals</strong>; investors like illustrations, e.g. graphs, charts, business
models, and tables. Find them online (with references) or create your own.</p><h2>Considerations</h2><p><strong>Aim:</strong> What decision(s) actually need to be made?</p><p><strong>Audience:</strong> Who is making these decisions? Their interests as a business should be considered, as well as
their style, i.e., grand vision or facts 'n' figures.</p><p><strong>Arrangement and Appearance:</strong> How is it going to look? Alongside a good
structure, the appearance is just as important. Information should be easy to find, the
writing should be engaging, and diagrams should look pretty.
</p><h2>Structure</h2><p>For all types of business cases , there will be roughly 7 aspects to the business case.</p><h3>Introduction and Background</h3><p>This details the purpose of the document, i.e., the business case for the
project, and the background of the proposed project respectively.</p><h3>Management Summary</h3><p>Also known as an Executive Summary, it describes the problem/opportunity the
project intends to address and states the options considered for the project.
All should state why they have (not) been recommended, and the recommended
option should further detail the expected business benefits.</p><p>This makes the management summary the most important part of the business case,
as most 'executive readers', i.e. potential customers, are cash-rich but
time-poor.</p><h3>Description of the Problem</h3><p>Elaborating further, this adds adds detail to the business problem &
opportunity. It includes the available options to solve the problem, with the
considerations and justifications for viable and rejected options. The option of
doing nothing should also be discussed.</p><h3>Cost/Benefit Analysis</h3><p>This quantifies the costs of carrying out the project and the expected benefits. The costs can either be
tangible, like <q>it will cost x amount</q> or <q>an expected increase of 20% to the user base</q>; or intangible,
like long-term benefits or competitor elimination by offering new products.</p><p>Note: intangible benefits will be questioned by the project tenders, as their
benefit is subjective by nature.</p><h3>Impacts</h3><p>These are essentially the 'side-effects' of the project solution. For example,
developing a solution to automate a process within a business affects the
employees currently responsible for the manual process. This makes them hard to
quantify, as they predominantly affect the customer's business.</p><h3>Risks</h3><p>The principle risks must also be outlined, with a recommended option and
proposed measures to either avoid or mitigate them.</p><h3>Conclusions and Recommendations</h3><p>Lastly, a summary of the business case and the required decisions from the customer are found in the
<em>conclusions and recommendations</em>, based on the Management Summary.</p></main></body></html>
