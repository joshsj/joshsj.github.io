title: Introduction to User-centric Design

Developers often develop for themselves, and will be motivated to develop
products that work for them. However, we are not typical users so many
considerations must be made:

- Demographics - UX and UI must be intuitive specifically to the user-base
- Technical familiarity
- Domain familiarity (or lack thereof) - either way, not too simple or complex

Furthermore, <!--excerpt-->users no longer accept bad design; there are many
alternatives on modern and most users are familiar with good
design.<!--excerpt-->

## Design Focus

Any part of an interactive system that users interact with

- Physically: input
- Perceptually: feedback
- Conceptually: what is it and what does it do?

## Lifecycle

1. Analysis

   - Starting point
   - Who is the user?
     - Child (intuitive but simple)
     - Teen (fastest and hardest to please)
     - Old (unintuitive and simple)
   - User domain knowledge is also important to consider; under or over-detailed
     applications can cause issues

2. Design

   - Wireframes
     - Visual demonstration of the function design of the application (layout
       and flow)
   - Prototypes

3. Evaluation
4. Implementation
5. Deployment

## User Inclusion

_Participatory design_ is where users provide feedback during the design
process. As wireframes are produced by the designed, the client an feed back
iteratively.

_Co-design_ is where users are actively involved in the design process,
providing contributions to the design in addition to feedback during the later
stages.
