Analysing a problem involves identifying the overriding problem to establish its
causes and effects, plus the goals of its solution.

To analyse the goals of a system, we can first look at _usability_ --- the
functional impact of a system:

- Effective to use
- Efficient to use
- Safe to use
- Have good utility
- Easy to learn
- Easy to remember how to use

We can also look at _User Experience (UX)_ --- the effect of a system on the
user:

- Satisfying
- Enjoyable
- Engaging
- Pleasurable
- Exciting
- Entertaining
- Helpful
- Motivating
- Emotionally fulfilling

## User Profiles

A _user profile_ are a set of characteristics taken from a typical user of a
system. A product can have any number of user profiles, depending on the scope
of the system's demographic. Attributes should be all/only be relevant to the
system; for example:

- Age range
- Physical competences
- Perceptual competences
- Education Level
- Domain Knowledge & experience
- Interests
- Financial status
- Social grouping
- Religion, nationality, culture

If we consider a teenager, we get:

> - 13 to 18
> - Limited finances
> - Varied physical strength (but considerable energy)
> - Likely to have good hand-eye coordination
> - Education is varied but likely to be full-time
> - Interests 'youth-related'
> - Cohesive peer group
> - Possibly limited respect for authorityâ€¦

## Personas

Where user profiles are a generic assessment of the user-base, _user personas_
are rich descriptions of typical users for a system. By specifying the target
user(s), designed can further tailor a product to its end-users.

They specify a theoretical or an actual end-user requiring an age, personal
background, personal needs, etc., and are formatted as a paragraph.

{% quote "Example User Persona" %}

Betty is 37 years old, she has been Warehouse Manager for five years and worked
for Simpkins Brothers Engineering for twelve years. She didn't go to university,
but has studied in her evenings for a business diploma. She has two children
aged 15 and 7 and does not like to work late. She did part of an introductory
in-house computer course some years ago, but it was interrupted when she was
promoted and could no longer afford to take the time. Her vision is perfect, but
her right-hand movement is slightly restricted following an car accident three
years ago. She is enthusiastic about her work and is happy to delegate
responsibility and take suggestions from her staff. However, she does feel
threatened by the introduction of yet another new computer system (the third in
her time at SBE)

## Task Analysis

This a generic term referring to a variety of techniques for analysing and
representing goals and tasks.

_User goals_ are derived from the activities in which end-users engage: a state
an end-user wishes to achieve.

_User tasks_ describe the functionality to achieve a task: a user activity
required to bring about a goal.

For example, the goal, 'know where next week's lecture is', can be described
with a task, 'a user activity required to bring about a goal '.

A working design can be validated through a comparison to user goals and tasks:

- Does it reduce user effort?
- Does it improve user performance?
- Does it aid/assist their use?

## Scenarios

_Scenarios_ are an informal narrative story: simple, 'natural', personal, and
not generalisable. Ultimately, these target the when and where, referred to as
the system's context.

Physical context could include where the user is, what their physical situation
is, and what else is happening around them. Temporal context could include:
timing, order of events, and other events.

A basic outline of a scenario consists of:

- Names of the individuals
- Where they are
- Why they are doing 'it' (the action in the scenario)
- Describe what else they are doing at the same time
