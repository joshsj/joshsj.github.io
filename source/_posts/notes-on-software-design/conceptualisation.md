Moving from analysis progresses the contextual information gathered into a
_conceptualisation_. <!--excerpt-->Basically, we're starting to make something
tangible.<!--excerpt--> The design phase is always addressed in an iterative
approach.

There are two main areas of conceptualisation: conceptual, trying to capture
what the product will do and how; and physical, the details of the design,
structure, layout etc.

## Prototypes

{% quote "Bill Verplank" %}

Prototyping is externalising and making concrete a design idea for the purpose
of evaluation

{% endquote %}

Simply, prototypes are a tangible representations of a solution. They are the
first representation of a system for the client to accept/decline your concept
for the solution.

### Fidelity

_Prototype fidelity_ describes how closely the prototype conveys the
look-and-feel of the final product: low is simple, high is complex.

Low-fidelity prototypes allow designers to conceptualise layout, structure,
interface, etc., early in the process. They are cheap and quick to produce,
e.g., wireframes.

High fidelity prototypes match the look and feel to the final product
closely/entirely, allowing designers to test the content with end users and
collect direct feedback. They are high-cost, meaning they are produced later and
to be refined and reused.

### Compromise

All prototypes involve compromises; for software-based prototyping, this could
affect functionality, appearance, or performance. There are two types of
compromise: horizontal, having a wide range of function but little detail; and
vertical, the opposite.

Choosing the right type of compromise is important to attain more/better
feedback from the client. Users with more domain knowledge than technical would
most likely benefit from vertical prototypes; they understand the content but
the functionality is their downfall (and vice-versa).

## Storyboarding

_Storyboards_ visualise a process in the application, often extending a
scenario, allowing designers to address fundamental aspects of the concept such
as:

- Will Roger be able to read that text?
- We have lots of users who are afraid of new technology; will the interface
  scare them?
- What happens if they don't have a bank account?
- They're experienced users, will they be satisfied with a step-by-step
  approach?

## Wireframes

A basic representation of the functional elements in a design concept, such as
the layout of a web page. Their quality can range from a 'back-of-an-envelope'
sketch to a full design, intended to provide an early approximation of how a
user will interact with the system. There are different types:

- High-level
  - Structure without content
- Flow
  - Demonstrate the flow of a single task
  - Requires multiple wireframes
- Modular wireframe
  - Demonstrate the flexibility/changeability of the interface
  - Individual components can add/move/delete
  - Re-arrangeable to try different layouts
