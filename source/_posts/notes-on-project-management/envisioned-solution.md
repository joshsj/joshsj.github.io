Because project management in IT can be volatile, <!--excerpt-->the envisioned
solution for a project must be clear, not only to guide future progress but also
to provide an initial impression upon the end-users and
stakeholders.<!--excerpt-->

An envisioned solution should cover the project's goal, which asserts whether it
solves the business need; and clarity, to ensure the client understands what the
end-product will look like.

From this, project management can then identify what is to be done and how the
work is to be accomplished, specifically:

- What is the customer's product vision?
- What is the scope of the project and its constraints (including the business
  case)?
- Who are the right participants to include in the project team?
- How will the team deliver the product (approach)?
- What are the high-level requirements for the system?

## The What

Initial requirements envisioning is particularly important for scaling agile
software development techniques to larger, more complex, or globally distributed
development efforts.

The goal is to understand the requirements at a high-level, as opposed to a
detailed requirements specification early in the lifecycle, i.e., the
traditional and risky 'Big Requirements Up Front' (BRUF).

## The Why

One reason to address the top-level requirements is to answer fundamental
business questions, such as what the vision for the solution (scope), how long
do you think it's going to take (schedule), and how much is it going to cost
(expected budget).

Another reason is to reduce business risk, as the project requirements can be
produced later (and potentially iteratively).

Lastly, any critical business issues can be clarified early on. For example, if
the project team is unsure whether to implement a complex aspect of the system
in-house, the requirements can document the uncertainty and address it after
other aspects of the solution have been built.

## The How

_Usage models_ explore how users will work with the system, which is critical to
understand what they need. These could be user-case models or user stories.

Alternatively, a _domain model_ demonstrates the main business domains of the
system and how they relate. As such, it should be a simple model, only
containing the main entities in the system. Relationships should include
cardinality and optionality.

_User interface models_ are very helpful to stakeholders, as they represent how
the end project could look. If they can envision the solution using it, the
remaining work is simply to implement the business functionality behind it.

Regardless of the chosen model, the tool used should be the easiest. Simple
models can be drawn up on whiteboards/paper, but using a more capable tool is
fine if it makes life easier.
