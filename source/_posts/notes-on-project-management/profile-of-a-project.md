What on earth to project managers do?

<!-- more -->

## Pre-Project

Starting to think about business cases, justification, and vendor scrutiny: is
the project viable?

## Project Startup

Producing the initial documents as the foundation of the project development,

- Project initiation document (PID)
- Project plan
- Quality plan (how can we assess the end product?)
- Risk management plan (how can we assess the risks of creating the product?)
- Project organisation & administration

## Development

The development stage handles preparation of documentation, site surveys and
preparation; data acquisition and take-on; and system development.

- Requirement specifications (what does the client want?)
- Technical specification (translation of business requirements)
- Module specifications (dividing the project to separate concerns)
- Prototypes & wireframes
- System test results
- Acceptance methodologies
  - User
  - Factory

## Completion

Delivering the deliverables to the customer. This shouldn't be the first time
the user sees the product; wireframes, and later prototypes, should have been
demonstrated to the user to attain feedback reguarding the end product.

This stage also includes:

- Staff/user training and familiarisation
- Acceptance testing - ensures the client is happy with the product
- System commissioning - implementing the new/updated product into production
- Customer takeover - operation is passed to the client

## Operation

- In-service live running
- Warranty, support, and maintainers
- Enhancements
  - New features
  - Changes to existing product

## Post-Project

Looks at what went well and what went badly using a post-project review report.
