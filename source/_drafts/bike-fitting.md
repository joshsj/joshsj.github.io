Taken from the

series from the Francis Cade YouTube channel.

I like BikeFitJames. As he often explains, many bike fitters are very
systematic, relying exclusively on data produced by specialized equipment to
conclude how an individual should interact with their bicycle.

This series, plus supporting vlogs, demonstrate why this is a poor approach, why
a pragmatic approach is better, and how he gets people comfortable on a bike.
Thanks James.

## To Do

- Saddle Height
- Saddle Setback
- Saddle Tilt
- Handlebar Reach
- Handlebar Drop
- Handlebar Width
- Shoes

## An Outline

People interact with a bike in three places:

- _Controls_ (handlebars and levers)
- _Saddle_ (or seat)
- _Pedals_

The saddle takes the majority of the rider's weight and the pedals receive all
the rider's power. Getting these right provides the foundation of the fit, and
the physiological needs of the rider then dictate the placement of the controls.

### Effects of bicycle design

As the sport has evolved, bicycle design has changed to reflect (and drive) the
needs of riders. A traditional 56cm frame would measure 56cm on the top tube and
seat tube with little handlebar drop. Modern race-oriented frames are more
aggressive; a longer top tube places more weight towards the front of the bike
and long 'n' low stems typically beef up the handlebar drop. Drivetrain
advancements, such as press-fit bottom brackets, have also narrowed bikes.

This has lead to a common problem in bike fitting: many everyday people struggle
to get comfortable on their expensive bikes. Maintaining an aggressive position
requires flexibility, strength, and little upper body mass (a pro). The average
desk worker is top heavy and lacks flexibility. Hitting the gym can help the
situation, but more muscle means more weight to support, especially when
skipping leg day.

### Adapting to a poor position

The human body can adapt to unergonomic positions very well, so noticeable
discomfort means the setup is really wrong in some way. Feeling stretched out?
The reach is too long. Feeling folded in half? Too much handlebar drop.

Bad positions may necessitate _acts of sacrifice_: unconscious adjustments made
by body to achieve a stable & sustainable position. An very typical case is seen
with excess saddle height, where riders sit off to their dominant side of the
saddle. This causes an asymmetric interaction with the bike, often leading to
one-sided issues (e.g., a saddle sore) and an imbalance of power output.

## Stance

The horizontal distance between your feet on the pedals.It is not the same as
_q-factor_, which instead measures the horizontal distance between the crank
arms.

### Adjustments

The easiest and free-est starting point is the cleat placement in the shoe: move
them inwards to increase stance, move them outwards to decrease stance.

Next come pedal washers, up to ~2mm. Any longer and you start running out of
pedal threads. Pedal spindle extenders and long-axle pedals get around this
issue.

Lastly, q-factor can also change stance, however needing new cranks to eek out
your stance to the extreme suggests a proper bike fit is in order.
