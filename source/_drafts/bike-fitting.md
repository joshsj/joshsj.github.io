Taken from the
[Bike Fit Tuesdays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNLQY6gBZsg&list=PLMZ241fyVfiv3eAJ4UYkzeb2JltpLSlzs)
series from the Francis Cade YouTube channel.

I like BikeFitJames. As he often explains, many bike fitters are very
systematic, relying exclusively on data produced by specialized equipment to
conclude how an individual should interact with their bicycle.

This series, plus supporting vlogs, demonstrate why this is a poor approach, why
a pragmatic approach is better, and how he gets people comfortable on a bike.

Thanks James.

## Goals

## Overall Positioning

People interact with a bike in three places:

- _Controls_ (handlebars and levers)
- _Saddle_ (or seat)
- _Pedals_

<!--  premise of engine and controls  -->

<!-- acts of sacrifice -->

## Stance

The horizontal distance between your feet on the pedals.

It is not the same as _q-factor_, which instead measures the horizontal distance
between the crank arms.

<!-- changes in standard width over time -->

### Adjustment

The easiest and free-est starting point is the cleat placement in the shoe: move
them inwards to increase stance, move them outwards to decrease stance.

Next come pedal washers, up to ~2mm, pedal spindle extenders, or long-axle
pedals.

Lastly, q-factor can also change stance, however needing new cranks to eek out
your stance to the extreme suggests a proper bike fit is in order.
