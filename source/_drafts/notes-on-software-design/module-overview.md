Since these are taken from a university module, we naturally have stuff like
this.

## Aims

The module aims to explore the role and nature of design in software
development, to make use of industrially-relevant techniques and tools, and to
develop (relatively) 'large scale' software.

We will also be expected to challenge and question the concepts and points we
raise; design choices are subjective and even the module leaders may learn from
our decisions.

## Outcomes

- Use design strategies effectively to guide the production of solutions in a
  complex problem domain
- Select and apply contemporary design techniques to generate effective and
  usable software designs
- Use designs to construct non-trivial software systems
- Use experience gained during the design and development case-studies to
  discuss and critically evaluate the impact of design approaches on software
  qualities
- Discuss and evaluate current design techniques in particular development
  contexts, and the role of these techniques in addressing issues and
  trade-offs, that arise during the development of complex software systems
