# Hello

I'm a spirited software developer from Manchester seeking a job in full stack
web development. Any tech stack is a good tech stack, but .NET, Vue & SQL is my
favourite.

I'm close to completing my degree in Software Engineering at Sheffield Hallam. I
also have a GCSE and A Level in Computer Science. On top of my GCSE and an
elective module, my French is coming along as well.

When I'm not coding, I tinker with my bike and mechanical keyboards. Most
evenings involve cooking and music, and I've followed Formula 1 and the
professional CS:GO scene for years.

Check out my [projects](/projects), blog [posts](/posts),
