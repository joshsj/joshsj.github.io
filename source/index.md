I'm a spirited software developer from Manchester seeking a job in full stack
web development. Any tech stack is a good tech stack, but .NET, Vue and SQL is
my jam.

I have a First in Software Engineering from Sheffield Hallam, 14 months
experience developing full-stack web applications from a placement at
[3Squared](https://3squared.com), and a slowly improving grasp of French.

When I'm not coding, I fiddle with my bike and mechanical keyboards. Most
evenings involve cooking and music, and I've followed Formula 1 and the
professional CS:GO scene for years.
