# Hello

I'm a spirited software developer from Manchester seeking a job in full stack
web development. Any tech stack is a good tech stack, but .NET, Vue & SQL is my
favourite.

I'm close to completing my degree in Software Engineering at Sheffield Hallam,
during which I undertook a 14-month placement at
[3Squared](https://3squared.com) and took a French elective module.
<em title="With Duolingo, I'm getting better every day.">Avec Duolingo, je
m'amÃ©liore tous les jours.</em>

When I'm not coding, I fiddle with my bike and mechanical keyboards. Most
evenings involve cooking and music, and I've followed Formula 1 and the
professional CS:GO scene for years.
