# Hello

Affirming the remarks in the project motivation, the conventional authentication
factors explored above do not account for conspiring users. Passwords and OTPs
can be easily shared, and biometrics cannot identify a specific account
associated to the credential.

Furthermore, biometrics may constrain the potential userbase: some people wear
religious facial garments, some people don’t have fingerprints.

## And another thing

In a context with the potential for conspiring users, these methodologies alone
are not adequate to authenticate users, meaning RendezVous’s identification
process must incorporate additional data to securely clock in/out of a job.
