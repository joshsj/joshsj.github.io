- title: (Re)Learning CS
  status: Implementing this stuff so I remember it ðŸ˜•
  description:
    After finishing my degree, I took the summer off to recover both emotionally
    and intellectually. To keep my mind ticking over, I decided to (re)learn
    some computer science topics to focus on creating efficient and elegant
    computational solutions, instead of rinse-and-repeat web apps. These notes
    roughly follow the [Data Structures course](https://stepik.org/course/579)
    on Stepik.
